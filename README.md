Welcome to the Symfony Standard Edition - a fully-functional Symfony2
application that you can use as the skeleton for your new applications.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start
using Symfony. For a more detailed explanation, see the [Installation][1]
chapter of the Symfony Documentation.

1) Installing the Standard Edition
----------------------------------

When it comes to installing the Symfony Standard Edition, you have the
following options.

### Use Composer (*recommended*)

As Symfony uses [Composer][2] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new Symfony application:

    php composer.phar create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition path/to/install 2.1.x-dev

For an exact version, replace 2.1.x-dev with the latest Symfony version (e.g. 2.1.1).

Composer will install Symfony and all its dependencies under the
`path/to/install` directory.

### Download an Archive File

To quickly test Symfony, you can also download an [archive][3] of the Standard
Edition and unpack it somewhere under your web server root directory.

If you downloaded an archive "without vendors", you also need to install all
the necessary dependencies. Download composer (see above) and run the
following command:

    php composer.phar install
